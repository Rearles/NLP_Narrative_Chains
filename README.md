# NLP_Narrative_Chains

To run this code: 
Download Neuralcoref (This is needed for the Narrative Chains to work)
There's a bug with using pip install neuralcoref, so you need to go through a couple of steps. 

Step 1:  install cython library: 'pip install cython'

Step 2: Download the code from this link:mhttps://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref as a zip file 

Step 3: Copy the path of that file and run python3 -m pip install (that path that you copied here)

After you finish this, you should be able to run this using python3 example.py
